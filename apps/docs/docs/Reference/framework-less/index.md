# Using Disploy without the CLI

Using the Disploy CLI is completely optional, though reccomended. It's purpose is to bundle your bot into a single file that can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers or imported into your own project. If you don't want to use the CLI, you can still use Disploy, but you'll have to bundle your bot yourself.

:::tip

Think of it like this:

- Disploy is a library that you can use to build bots.
- Disploy's CLI is a tool that turns Disploy into a framework, it takes in commands and bundles your bot into a single file that can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers or imported into your own project.
