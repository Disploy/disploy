# Getting started

Firstly before we do anything, we are going to need to bootstrap our project with or without the framework.

## Should I use the framework?

- Easy to prototype and deploy ([`disploy dev`](/docs/getting-started/cli-framework/learning-the-workflow/dev-mode) and [`disploy deploy`](/docs/getting-started/cli-framework/learning-the-workflow/deploying))
- Serverless deployment out of the box ([`disploy deploy`](/docs/getting-started/cli-framework/learning-the-workflow/deploying))
- Easy to scale
- Easy to maintain

## Should I not use the framework?

- You want to use your own deployment method
- You want to not be forced into serverless environments
- You want to use `@disploy/ws` allowing you to receive events and use voice

## Bootstrap your project
